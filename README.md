# shopping cart from scratch
This is a lesson on Youtube You can see how to build this project from scratch from [here](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXf60-isebOGYVtat5ob7nXT50V-p8Se2) 
And this is the project we gonna build
## Why I follow this playlist ?
- In this Playlist we gonna build a complete project about shopping cart.
- We will use firebase realtime database to show our product and to control our shopping cart.
- So we can add, minus and delete a product in the shopping cart.
- also will use firebase authentication
- We will secure the firebase database data and will put rolls so every user can only access his data even if he got our configuration object.
- we gonna use redux toolkit and will use thunk as well.
and that's why it will be a great opportunity to join me in this project.
