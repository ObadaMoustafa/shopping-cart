# Shopping Cart
[Presentation for CS50](https://youtu.be/CVT3GlA19mQ)


## [Demo](https://dev-mentor-shopping-cart.netlify.app/)
## Why I follow this playlist ?
- In this Playlist we gonna build a complete project about shopping cart.
- We will use firebase realtime database to show our products and to control our shopping cart.
- So we can add, subtract and delete a product in the shopping cart.
- also will use firebase authentication
- We will secure the firebase database data and will put rolls so every user can only access his data even if he got our configuration object.
- We gonna use redux toolkit and will use thunk as well.
- The UI will be built with MUI material react liberary
Then that's why it will be a great opportunity to join me in this project.
